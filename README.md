a primitive version of wordle run in the ~~termindle~~ terminal.

guess the 5 letter word in 6 turns or less.

 **features + limitations**
- shows you the letters used in your past guesses
- shows letter matches between your guess and the secret word
- shows attempts left after each guess
- doesnt show correct letters in wrong space like traditional wordle (sort of hard/impossible to show clearly in terminal)

made in python.
